        <p>In today's world, <b>knowledge</b> can often feel like a heavy weight, revealing truths that are uncomfortable and sometimes overwhelming. You discover that the more they know, the more you realise how little control you truly have, making awareness
            almost exhausting. Meanwhile, others live in a state of <b>ignorance</b>, untouched by the stress of global issues, digital overload, and constant information. In a strange way, this creates a contrast where <b>knowledge</b> becomes a burden
            while ignorance appears blissful, offering a simple escape from the chaos of modern life like this dog below.</p>
